We love to get feedback from our users, here are some of the highlights!

If you want to get a sense of what the app is like before downloading it, you can [see more reviews right here](/reviews/) or directly on the App Store.

> Great daily app to develop shadow boxing skills… never the same twice and continue to add features. Premium is definitely worth it. Handy timer in the app as well

> This app helps me lose weight and get boxing experience before I even start

> The greatest boxing workout app. Ever.

It's also nice to see that people see some value in the app even without the premium subscription:

> App is tremendous for folks who don’t have a gym to train at. Even the free version will give you a good workout, the paid version is an added bonus for variety.

> I have tried many apps before but this one is best even if you don’t take premium you can make something good outta this
