Boxing provides the perfect exercise routines for speeding up the metabolism and aiding fat loss. A well-planned boxing regime provides an aerobic workout that gets all the muscle groups moving and, most importantly, the heart beating. Ideal for pushing past those post-Christmas blues.

Not only does it assist with stamina and endurance, but it can lift your mood - something extremely useful at present. The stress-reducing impact of punching a bag, pads or body belt is always a bonus. Shadow boxing helps with posture and balance, as does skipping.
