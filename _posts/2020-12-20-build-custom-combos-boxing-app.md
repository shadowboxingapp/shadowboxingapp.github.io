A lot of people were asking for it, so we're very happy to announce the  brand new exercise creator in the latest version of [Shadow Boxing App](/)! Create your custom pad work routines, set  your own combos and take even more control of the way you're using the  app.

## How to create your custom pad work routine

First go to the custom workout section. There you'll see a custom exercise section: tap the link to add a new one and follow the instructions.

<div style='text-align: center'><img src='/assets/web_screenshot_3.png' style='width: 250px;margin: 10px 0px 30px 0px;' alt='Custom boxing training app'/></div>

Eventually you'll get to the combo creator keyboard. It might look a bit weird at first, but keep in mind that each key correspond to a particular move:

- 1 for jab
- 2 for cross
- 3 for left hook
- 4 for right hook
- 5 for left uppercut
- 6 for right uppercut
- b for body shots
- P for parry
- D for duck
- S for slip
- C for cover

<div style='text-align: center'><img src='/assets/web_screenshot_8.png' style='width: 250px;margin: 10px 0px 30px 0px;' alt='Build boxing combos from your iPhone'/></div>

Once you've added a few combinations, go back to your custom workout and start training. The app will call out punches so you can execute the techniques. Think of it like a [virtual pad work boxing session](/pad-work-boxing-reflexes/)!
