A lot of people were asking for it, so we're very happy to announce the  brand new exercise creator in the latest version of [Shadow Boxing App](/)! Create your custom pad work routines, set  your own combos and take even more control of the way you're using the  app.

## How to create your custom pad work routine

First go to the custom workout section. There you'll see a custom exercise section: tap the link to add a new one and follow the instructions.

<div style='text-align: center'><img src='/assets/screenshots/web_screenshot_3.png' style='width: 250px;margin: 10px 0px 30px 0px;' alt='Custom boxing training app'/></div>

Once you've set up things properly, you'll get to the boxing combo creator keyboard. It might look a bit weird at first, but keep in mind that each key correspond to a particular boxing move:

- 1 for jab
- 2 for cross
- 3 for left hook
- 4 for right hook
- 5 for left uppercut
- 6 for right uppercut
- b for body shots
- P for parry
- D for duck
- S for slip
- C for cover

<div style='text-align: center'><img src='/assets/screenshots/web_screenshot_8.png' style='width: 250px;margin: 10px 0px 30px 0px;' alt='Build boxing combos from your iPhone'/></div>

Once you've added a few combinations, go back to your custom workout and start training. The app will call out punches so you can execute the techniques. Think of it like a [virtual pad work boxing session](/pad-work-boxing-reflexes/) using your iOS device! You then just need to follow along and throw the right punches as the app says so. To improve the effectiveness of the workout, it's better to not stay static and keep moving around in between combos.
