We created our [free](/free-boxing-timer/) boxing timer to match the reality of boxing at home, outside or at the gym and it's used daily by thousands of boxers across the world. Here's a breakdown of what we think makes it the best boxing timer out there!

## Setting Up The Boxing Timer

### Rounds Timing

You can alternate "fight" rounds and "rest" rounds. This is perfect for sparring, but it also works well with many HIIT workouts like Tabata. And since we know that people often do the same kind of workouts, the settings will default to the ones you recently used.

### Smart Presets

If you want to quickly start a sparring session, you can directly pick from the appropriate rules, like pro boxing, amateur boxing... but also MMA, Muay Thai and more.

### Sweating the Details

Advanced settings make a big difference to really have the experience you need.

- Add or remove vocal cues, like calling out round numbers.
- Make round changes louder, so that you can hear it in a crowded gym
- Adjusting the end of round warning sound. Many timer just have it at 30 seconds... but what if you want it at 10, or 20?
- Having a warmup period at the beginning. Personally I use it to put on my gloves!

It's also worth mentioning that the app has even more settings, like changing the actual sounds if you prefer a bell ringing to beeps and boops.

### Save Your Custom Timers

Finally, once you have found all the right settings you can just save them and re-use them later!

## Using The Timer

### Large Detailed Display

First of all, you can see the timer from afar, including the ongoing round progress but also the overall progress. This is perfect, because when you are in the middle of sparring you don't want to be spending more than a second figuring out how much time is left.

### More Granular Details

If you want more details, the top of the screen has you covered.

### Large Onscreen Controls

You are sweating, tired, and you want to pause. No worries, the entire screen defaults to "pause"! If you want something else, like skipping a round, or restarting it, which are the two most common actions, the large bottom controls have you covered.

### Theme Change Between Rest and Fight

When you switch from a fight period to a rest period, the screen switches from black to white, making it obvious from afar what happened.

### Heart Rate Tracking

If you have a compatible device, like AirPods Pro 3, you even get onscreen heart rate monitoring during your workouts!

## Bonus Rounds

### No Ads and Free

The timer is free, only the feature to save timers is part of a paid package. There is no ads in the app, so you won't get interrupted mid-workout.

### Offline

A timer should work offline, always... but some apps just don't function without internet, mainly due to their use of ads and tracking. This timer is made to work offline so you can work in a basement, abroad or in plane mode for full focus.

### Boxing Timer on Apple Watch

The timer works [on the Apple Watch](/boxing-with-apple-watch/) as well, independently. This means you can start a workout directly from your watch and start boxing.

### Stats and Streaks

The app keeps track of your workouts and gives you graphs, streaks and more.

### Apple Health and Calories Tracking

You can decide to send all your workouts to Apple Health, including calories tracking. This will adapt to your bodyweight, gender and height for more accurate tracking.

### iPad

The app works on iPad and adapts to the larger layout. Perfect if you want to setup a workout area in your garage.
