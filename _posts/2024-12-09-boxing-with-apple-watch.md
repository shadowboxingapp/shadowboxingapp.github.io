## Hands-Free Monitoring

Boxing is all about using your hands, which means constantly checking your phone or a wall clock isn’t practical. With an Apple Watch, you can track time, heart rate, and performance metrics directly from your wrist. Features like timers and haptic feedback help keep you focused on your punches instead of the clock.

## Precision Timing for Rounds

Boxers thrive on rhythm, and that means having precise control over your training intervals. The Apple Watch lets you set up customizable round timers with rest intervals, ensuring you stick to your plan. Apps like [the **Shadow Boxing App**](/) even bring professional-grade timers to your wrist, complete with notifications when it’s time to start or rest.

The Apple Watch syncs with the Fitness app on your iPhone, giving you detailed insights into your sessions over time. Plus, closing your activity rings during a boxing workout is always satisfying!

## Stay Connected Without Interruptions
