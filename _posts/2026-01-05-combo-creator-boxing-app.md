## What Is the Combo Creator?

The Combo Creator is a flexible, interactive tool inside the app that lets you **design your own punch combinations**, tailored to your skill level, training goals, and preferred rhythm. Rather than following pre-set patterns alone, you get to become the architect of your workout, crafting sequences that challenge you and keep training fresh.

## How Does It Work?

### Creating a custom exercise

First, pick create a workout.

<div style='text-align: center'><img src='/assets/blog/comboCreator/home.png' style='width: 300px;margin: 10px 0px 30px 0px; border-radius: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;' alt='Create custom boxing combos with an app'/></div>

Then, instead of picking pre-made exercises, you're going to create your own.

<div style='text-align: center'><img src='/assets/blog/comboCreator/custom.png' style='width: 300px;margin: 10px 0px 30px 0px; border-radius: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;' alt='Create custom boxing combos with an app'/></div>

You can now pick a name and a default time between combo. 

<div style='text-align: center'><img src='/assets/blog/comboCreator/create.png' style='width: 300px;margin: 10px 0px 30px 0px; border-radius: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;' alt='Create custom boxing combos with an app'/></div>

### Adding boxing combos

If you want the app to wait a bit longer before triggering the next combo, you can add a custom delay for each combo. This is perfect if you want to alternate quick attacks and longer combos.

<div style='text-align: center'><img src='/assets/blog/comboCreator/timing.png' style='width: 300px;margin: 10px 0px 30px 0px; border-radius: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;' alt='Create custom boxing combos with an app'/></div>
