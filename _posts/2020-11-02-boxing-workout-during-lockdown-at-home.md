Lockdown has affected many activities that people often took for granted, especially fitness and exercise. No sport has been exempted from the impacts, including boxing. 

Staying focused and motivated is a key battle in the fight game, where one missed step or slight lapse in concentration can result in a knockout loss or even worse - serious injury.

## The risks of stopping training

Despite being viewed as the ultimate one-person endeavour, boxers are used to training in a competitive environment with fellow fighters, interacting with coaches and trainers, sparring and going on group runs. Once this element is removed, lethargy can creep in.

Therefore, it is so important that boxers carry on training in lockdown even if they are unable to work out in their regular gym. Failing to maintain an acceptable level of conditioning can have detrimental long-term effects on a boxer’s fitness and technique.

Fighters who blow up in weight between contests will suffer on fight night. Letting the weight increase and going weeks without shadow boxing, practising drills or engaging in recognised workouts can be damaging.

## It's important to stay motivated

It is important to stay in shape and remain motivated. Replicate the benefits of [pad work][3], [shadow boxing][1], punch bag sessions and core fitness routines. Keep combinations sharp and on point. Maintain the muscle memory movements of jab-overhand right-left hook combinations. Stick to the regular times of activity, rest and recovery, keeping in line with gym standards.

If a boxer stops throwing accurate, well-timed flurries, stops dodging punches, working on his/her defence or lets fitness drop to such a degree, then they will lose their edge during lockdown and beyond. 

Staying fit and working on technique is vitally important and remaining motivated to do so is the key.

## Keep on boxing during lockdown with a mobile app

One option to stay active is to train with an application. For instance you can use the [Shadow Boxing Workout][2] app in your daily boxing routine.

This app will give you exercises to complete like virtual pad work (calling out punches), dodge drills or punching bag training. You can also share videos of your training online to keep in touch with other boxers.

On top of all this, the app will let you follow your progress and statistics to stay motivated even if you are stuck at home.
