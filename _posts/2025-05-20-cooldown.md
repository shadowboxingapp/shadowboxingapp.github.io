We’re excited to introduce a new feature in [The Shadow Boxing App](/): **guided cooldowns**. 

After an intense boxing session, your body and mind need time to reset. With this update, you can now add a short recovery routine at the end of your workouts—whether you’re looking for simple breathing exercises or want to try something more advanced like 4-7-8 breathing.

## Why Cooldowns Matter After Boxing

Cooldowns are often overlooked, but they’re a critical part of any workout—especially in a sport like boxing where your body is pushed to the limit. A proper cooldown helps:

- Gradually lower your heart rate and blood pressure
- Prevent dizziness or nausea after high-intensity rounds
- Reduce post-workout muscle soreness
- Improve flexibility and circulation
- Mentally signal that training is complete

Whether you’ve been shadowboxing for 5 minutes or grinding through a full-length session, cooldowns help your body shift from high gear back to a calm state. Think of them as the last round in your routine—quiet, controlled, and essential.

## What Is 4-7-8 Breathing—and Why Use It?

One of the options now available in our cooldowns is **4-7-8 breathing**, a technique used to reduce stress and promote recovery. It works like this:

1. **Inhale** through your nose for 4 seconds
2. **Hold** your breath for 7 seconds
3. **Exhale** slowly through your mouth for 8 seconds

It’s a powerful tool that can help fighters regulate their nervous system after intense effort. For boxers, this is especially useful—it calms the mind, sharpens focus, and helps manage adrenaline after training or sparring. Done regularly, 4-7-8 breathing can even improve sleep and aid long-term performance.

## Now available in the app!

You can now try it [in the app](/), either on its own or after a guided boxing workout.
