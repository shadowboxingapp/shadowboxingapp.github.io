This article is written for **true beginners**: no jargon overload, no complicated setups. Just **clear, effective boxing combos** you can practice at home or in the gym.

## Boxing Combos and The 4 Basic Punches

A **boxing combo** is a sequence of punches thrown one after another without stopping. Instead of thinking punch by punch, you think in **flows**.

Example:  "Jab → Cross"  instead of  "Jab… stop… Cross"

Before combos, let’s align on punch numbers (this is standard boxing notation):

1. [**Jab**](/how-to-jab-boxing/) – Lead hand, straight punch
2. [**Cross**](/how-to-throw-a-cross-boxing/) – Rear hand, straight punch
3. **Lead Hook** – Lead hand, horizontal
4. **Rear Hook** – Rear hand, horizontal

If you’re orthodox (left foot forward):  Jab = left hand, Cross = right hand. If you’re southpaw, it’s reversed.

## Beginner Boxing Combos

### Combo #1: Jab – Cross (1–2)

This is the most important combo in boxing, and used very commonly.

Why it matters:

- Builds balance and coordination
- Teaches hip and shoulder rotation
- Foundation for all future combos
- Ends with a powerful cross, perfect for actual combat

How to throw it:

1. Snap the jab straight out
2. Rotate hips and shoulders into the cross
3. Bring both hands back to guard

Beginner tip: clean technique matters more than speed.

### Combo #2: Jab – Cross – Jab (1–2–1)

A great combo to build rhythm and range control.

Why it’s great:

- Keeps you active
- Trains fast hand recovery
- Perfect for shadowboxing

Key focus:

- Light, fast jabs
- No need for power on the last jab

### Combo #3: Jab – Cross – Lead Hook (1–2–3)

Your first combo with a rotational punch. Perfect to bypass your opponent's guard.

What you learn:

- Weight transfer
- Proper hook mechanics
- Staying balanced while rotating

Common mistake:
 Swinging the hook too wide.
 Keep it short, tight, and controlled.

### Combo #4: Jab – Lead Hook – Cross (1–3–2)

This combo feels awkward at first, which is exactly why beginners should practice it.

Why it’s important:

- Breaks predictable patterns
- Improves coordination
- Teaches punch transitions

Pro tip:
 Slow it down at first. Speed comes naturally later.

### Combo #5: Double Jab – Cross (1–1–2)

Simple, effective, and very realistic. The jab disrupts, and you end with a powerful cross.

Why it works:

- First jab measures distance
- Second jab distracts
- Cross lands with better timing

Beginner focus:
 First jab light, second jab sharper.

## How to Practice These Combos as a Beginner

[Shadow boxing](/what-is-shadow-boxing/) is a great option. You can practice it on your own or [with a boxing app](/add-app-in-boxing-training/). If you're not sure which one to pick, you can check our list of [the best boxing apps for 2026](/best-boxing-apps-2026/).

- 2 to 3 rounds of 2 minutes
- One combo per round, with some isolated punches
- Focus on form, breathing, and balance

Heavy bag:

- Start slow
- Reset your stance after each combo
- Exhale on every punch

Mental rule:
 If your guard drops, slow down.

## How Many Combos Should You Learn?

Five combos are enough to start.

Mastering a few basics beats knowing many poorly. Once these feel natural, you can add:

- Body shots
- Head movement
- Speed and intensity
- Uppercuts

There is virtually an infinite number of combos, the goal is to be able to have a few ones committed to muscle memory, and then be able to improvise. To get there, you can also practice with an app like [The Shadow Boxing App](/) that will call out combos.

## Final Advice

Boxing isn’t about hitting hard. It’s about **flow, balance, and consistency**.

Practice these beginner combos regularly and you’ll feel progress quickly, even without a coach.

Smooth first.
 Fast later.
 Powerful last. 🥊
