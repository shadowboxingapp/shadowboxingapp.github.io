We agree that the dark mode was long overdue, so we finally got it done: the dark mode is now available for the [Shadow Boxing App](/)! Let's take a quick look at how it looks like today.

The home tab with recommended workouts is looking sharp, especially with the quick start liquid glass button.

Tracking your stats and staying motivated in your boxing journey, but in low luminosity.

Watching tutorial videos never looked better! Real cinema experience.

Browsing through our many boxing workouts looks great, especially since it fits well with the already existing photos.

By default the app will use your system's settings, but you can of course pick your favorite version.
