## Why Boxing Is the Ultimate Summer Shred Workout

Boxing torches fat, tones muscle, and boosts your cardio fitness all in one go. In just 30 minutes, you can burn 300–500 calories while working your entire body. Unlike boring cardio, boxing keeps your mind and body engaged, with every jab, cross, and hook pushing you closer to your goals.

Plus, it’s low-equipment. All you need is space to move and the right guidance—like what you’ll get with the [Shadow Boxing App]().

## Build a Weekly Boxing Routine

Here’s a simple summer-focused boxing schedule to follow:

- **Monday: Technique + Core**
   Focus on shadow boxing fundamentals and core circuits. Get those abs popping with quick, controlled movements.
- **Wednesday: HIIT Boxing Blast**
   Mix short punching combos with high-intensity intervals like squat jumps or mountain climbers.
- **Friday: Power & Strength**
   Work on heavy punches and add resistance bands or light weights to build upper-body strength.
- **Weekend Bonus: Recovery Flow or Light Shadow boxing**
   Keep it active with light movement or yoga. Let your muscles repair while maintaining momentum.

You can follow structured workouts and mix-and-match routines using the [Shadow Boxing App](), which guides you round by round like a virtual coach in your corner.

## Stay Motivated and See Results

Progress comes fast when you stick with it. You’ll notice:
