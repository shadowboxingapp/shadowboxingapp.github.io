The newest version of [the app](/) provides a new guided footwork exercise, and we think you'll like it a lot! 

{% include preview.html %}

Obviously, footwork is super important in boxing because it helps you move around the ring quickly and stay balanced. 

Good footwork lets you dodge punches, get in position to land your own shots, and avoid getting trapped in a corner. It also keeps you steady so your punches have more power. If your feet are all over the place, youâ€™re more likely to get hit or throw weak punches, so staying light on your feet makes a huge difference.

This new exercise will ask you to move in a direction and then throw a quick combo. It might sound simple at first, but keeping up the pace, punching with proper technique and thinking about proper stance will keep you busy for a while!

Overall, this new footwork exercise is a great way to sharpen your boxing skills while keeping things fun and challenging. As you work on your speed, technique, and balance, you'll see just how much it pushes you.

Give it a try, and you'll feel the difference in your movement in no time!
