Our community has been asking for it — and we’ve been listening. Whether you're a boxer curious about adding kicks, or a kickboxing fan looking for structured, combo-based training, our new **Kickboxing Beta** is here to spice up your routine. And it’s just the beginning.

## Why Kickboxing?

Because footwork and fists are just part of the game — add knees and kicks, and you unlock a whole new dimension of fitness, coordination, and challenge. Kickboxing is a powerful full-body workout that:

- **Engages your entire body** — legs, core, shoulders, you name it.
- **Improves balance, flexibility, and agility.**
- **Burns major calories** while building serious endurance.

If you already love the flow and sweat of our boxing combos, get ready to take it to the next level.

## Why It’s a Beta

We’re calling it a *beta* because we’re building this **with you**. That means:

- You get **early access** to new kickboxing content before anyone else.
- You can **send us feedback** on what you love, what you want, and what’s missing.
- We’ll be **rolling out more kickboxing drills**, kicks, and techniques regularly.

It’s your chance to help shape the future of The Shadow Boxing App.

## Who’s It For?

- Boxers who want to **add some kicks** to their flow.
- Fitness fans looking for **high-intensity, high-reward** cardio.
- Kickboxing beginners who want a safe, structured, and fun way to start.
- Anyone who wants to feel strong, fast, and unstoppable.

No gloves, no gym, no problem. Just hit start and go.

## Boxing First, Always

While we’re thrilled to expand into kickboxing, let’s be clear — **boxing remains the heart of The Shadow Boxing App**. 

It’s where we started, and it’s what we do best. Our mission has always been to bring the magic of shadowboxing to everyone — anytime, anywhere. The timing, the rhythm, the footwork, the mental clarity — boxing is a craft we respect deeply, and we’re committed to constantly refining and expanding our boxing content to keep delivering the best experience for fighters at all levels.
