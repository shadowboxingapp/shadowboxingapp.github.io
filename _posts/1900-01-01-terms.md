If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing this site or application. The materials contained in this website are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.

## 2. Use License

1. 1) Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on ShadowBoxingWorkout's website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:

   a) modify or copy the materials;

   b) use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);

   c) attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on ShadowBoxingWorkout's website;

   d) remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or

   e) transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.

2. 2) This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by ShadowBoxingWorkout at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.

## 3. Subscription

You will be able to purchase a premium subscription to access all the features available in the application.

Depending on the option you pick, a purchase will be applied to your iTunes account on confirmation. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel anytime with your iTunes account settings. Any unused portion of a free trial will be forfeited if you purchase a subscription.

## 4. Disclaimer

- 1) The materials on ShadowBoxingWorkout's website are provided on an 'as is' basis. ShadowBoxingWorkout makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.

## 5. Your Health

Use of the ShadowBoxingWorkout app is at your own risk and you have to take your health into consideration before using the application.

In any case a condition for the use of the ShadowBoxingWorkout app is that you need to be in a good general state of health. In the eventuality of you having knowledge of any pre-existing medical conditions we advise you to seek medical advice from a doctor urgently before you start using this application in any capacity. In addition our female boxers should note that pregnant women and breast-feeding mothers should not do the workouts presented in the application.

ShadowBoxingWorkout should not be held responsible if you decide to use the app against or without medical recommendations.

While exercicing, pay attention to your body and general health and do not hesitate to stop at the first sign of problem.

When using additional equipment, like a jump rope, it is your responsibility to ensure that such equipment and tools are in good working condition and installed and/or set up properly. Misuse of such equipment could lead to injury. If you are unsure about the usage and/or maintenance of your equipment, you should not use it.

## 6. Limitations

In no event shall ShadowBoxingWorkout or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on ShadowBoxingWorkout's website, even if ShadowBoxingWorkout or a ShadowBoxingWorkout authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.

## 7. Accuracy of Materials

The materials appearing on ShadowBoxingWorkout's website could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. ShadowBoxingWorkout does not warrant that any of the materials on its website are accurate, complete or current. ShadowBoxingWorkout may make changes to the materials contained on its website at any time without notice. However ShadowBoxingWorkout does not make any commitment to update the materials.

## 8. Links

ShadowBoxingWorkout has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its website and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by ShadowBoxingWorkout of the site. Use of any such linked website is at the user's own risk.

## 9. Modifications

ShadowBoxingWorkout may revise these terms of service for its website at any time without notice. By using this website and the ShadowBoxingWorkout app you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these terms of service.

## 10. Governing Law

These terms and conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of France and you irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that location.
