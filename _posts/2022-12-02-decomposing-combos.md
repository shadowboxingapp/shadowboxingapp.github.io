We're always updating our boxing app with new features, workouts and exercises so that it never gets stale. In the latest version we've added a few interesting new things that we'd like to highlight.

{% include preview.html %}

## New boxing exercises

- **DECOMPOSING COMBOS:** Learn new complex combos step by step. This is both fun and helpful, since it can be hard to get into a new combo that includes varying levels, defensive movements and more. The app will break it down for you in a way that is easy to follow and memorize. After a few times doing the exercice, you'll be able to add a new combination to your arsenal!
- **HIT AND GET OUT:** Combos including a way to exit after punching to build good reflexes. Boxing is all about hitting and not getting hit, so having the instinct to get out of danger after a combo is key.

## New boxing workouts

Thanks to the new exercices, we've built a few new complete workouts that can range for a few minutes to a complete workout session.

- **IMPROVE YOUR COMBOS:** Practice a few easy combos and learn more complex ones.
- **SIMPLE DEFENSE:** Simple combos with defensive movements to build up muscle memory

## New boxing app feature

This feature doesn't have many new features, mostly content, but we are always adding small things, tweaking what's already there and fixing bugs.

- Combos can now include more defensive movements, like stepping back.
