At [The Shadow Boxing App](/), we believe fitness and the fun of boxing should never be gated by price tags or intimidating gym doors. That’s why we offer a library of **free workouts**—not as a teaser, but as a commitment to **accessibility, empowerment, and growth**.

Recently, we read a review that stopped us in our tracks:

> **Definitely a must get app** ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️
>
> If you’re a beginner you should definitely download this.
>
> I looked around at different boxing gyms and they’re just so expensive and the environments are a bit intimidating to a person brand new to the sport. I ended up downloading this app and the first few workouts have taught me so much and have really given me the sweats.
>
> I’m working out alone with this yet feel just as motivated to continue the workouts as if I were with a coach.

And they then conclude by:

> I’m definitely contemplating getting the paid version.

While we still need to charge something to keep the app running and make sure it still exists in the future, having someone really enjoying the free version is one of the reasons we do what we do.

## **Breaking the Price Barrier**

Boxing gyms can be expensive. Gear, classes, memberships—it adds up fast. We don’t think your first jab should cost you a fortune. Whether you're tightening your budget or testing the waters, our free workouts give you a **real chance to train**—not just a glorified preview.

The fact that workouts are generated on the spot means that even if you only rely on a few free workouts, you'll still get a fun and renewed experience each time. 

## **Welcoming Beginners, Not Overwhelming Them**

Walking into a gym can feel like stepping into a different world: the sounds, the routines, the seasoned boxers. For beginners, that can be more than intimidating—it can be paralyzing. We built our app to **gently guide you**, not throw you in the deep end. No judgment, no pressure. Just you, your space, and a clear voice coaching you forward.

Having a free tier is a way to discover if you like the experience or complement your existing fitness routine.

## **Creating Real Sweat, Real Progress**

Free doesn’t mean “easy.” Our free workouts are **designed by real coaches** and tested by many different boxers to build strength, skill, and stamina. You'll punch, move, and sweat. You’ll finish your session feeling stronger—physically and mentally.

## **Motivation That Lasts**

That’s everything to us. We want our app to be your **digital corner coach**—cheering you on, pushing you further, showing you what’s possible. Whether you stay with the free version or upgrade to unlock more content, our goal is to **spark your love for boxing** and help you keep going.

**Free isn’t a gimmick. It’s our invitation.**
 An invitation to move. To sweat. [To learn](/learn-boxing/). To start.

Because everyone deserves a chance to feel strong—right from round one.
