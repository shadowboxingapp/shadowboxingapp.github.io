HIIT, or high-intensity interval training, is a type of workout that is growing in popularity. It involves alternating short bursts of high-intensity exercise with brief periods of rest or low-intensity activity. HIIT can be done with almost any type of exercise and can be tailored to fit any fitness level.

High intensity training like this is especially good for boxing as it improves your explosiveness and ability to string together fast combos that will hit their target.

## What is HIIT training, and How Does it Work

HIIT, or high-intensity interval training, is a type of cardiovascular exercise that involves short alternating periods of intense anaerobic exercise with less-intense recovery periods. HIIT has been shown to be more effective than traditional aerobic exercise in terms of burning fat and improving cardiovascular health.

The basis of HIIT is that it allows the exerciser to do more work in a shorter period of time. The intense bursts of activity cause the body to release more adrenaline and other hormones that promote fat burning. The brief rest periods allow the body to recover and prepare for the next burst of activity.

## The Many Benefits of HIIT Training

If you're looking to get fit, you might wonder what the best type of exercise is. While many different types of exercise can help you reach your fitness goals, HIIT training is one of the most efficient and effective.

One of the best things about HIIT is that it can be adapted to any fitness level. If you're just starting out, you can begin with shorter intervals and work your way up as you get stronger. HIIT is also a great option for people who don't have a lot of time to workout; a HIIT workout can be completed in as little as 20 minutes.

There are many benefits to HIIT training. Some of the key benefits include:

- **Increased calorie burn**: One study found that HIIT can burn up to nine times more calories than traditional cardio exercises.

- **Increased muscle mass**: HIIT can help you build muscle mass and tone your body.

- **Improved cardiovascular health**: HIIT can improve your cardiovascular health and reduce your risk of heart disease.

- **Increased endurance**: HIIT helps improve your endurance and makes it easier to sustain high levels of activity for longer periods of time.
- **Increased explosiveness in boxing**: the high intensity of the exercises allow you to have bursts of energies, helping your punches to connect and have more impact.

If you're looking for an efficient and effective way to get fit, consider giving HIIT a try!

## How to Get Started with HIIT Training

If you’re looking to get started with HIIT training, there are a few things you need to know. First, HIIT is a type of high-intensity interval training that involves short, intense bursts of exercise followed by short periods of rest or recovery. Because it’s so fierce, HIIT is a great way to burn fat and improve your overall fitness level quickly.

You'll need a few pieces of equipment to get started with HIIT. Ideally, you'll want a weight bench, an adjustable weight bench, or a stability ball. You'll also need free weights ranging from 5 to 30 pounds and a timer or stopwatch.

Once you have the necessary equipment, you can begin your HIIT workout. To start, choose a challenging but manageable weight for the number of repetitions you plan to do. For example, if you're doing 12 repetitions, choose a weight that is challenging but not so heavy that you can only do 10 repetitions. Once you have chosen your weight, perform the following exercises for the prescribed number of repetitions:

1) Bench press - 12 repetitions

2) Bent-over row - 12 repetitions

3) Squat - 12 repetitions

4) Shoulder press - 12 repetitions

5) Curl - 12 repetitions

6) Triceps extension - 12 repetitions

7) Calf raise - 12 repetitions

8) Crunch - 20 repetitions

9) Russian twist - 20 repetitions

10) Hamstring curl - 20 repetitions

Rest for one minute after completing all 10 exercises. Then repeat the entire circuit two more times for a total of three rounds. If you find the workout too challenging, reduce the number of reps or choose a lower weight. Remember to always listen to your body and never push yourself beyond your limits.
