Once you'll have mastered the jab, you'll be able to use it as a solid starting point for [all your basic boxing combinations](/boxing-basic-combos/).

## Getting in your stance

To start off, get in your fighting stance, one foot forward, hands up to your chin. If you are right handed, put your left foot forward. If you are left handed, put your right foot forward.

You should keep your shoulders and arms nice and relaxed. If you tense up, you'll be less effective and will risk an injury.

## Punching

First extend your forward fist toward your oponent's face. While you do so, rotate your arm. This means your shoulder, elbow and wrist so that at the end of the punch your palm is facing downward. While punching, your shoulder movement will help cover your face and bring more power to your technique.

Once you have extanded your arm, bring it back quickly to get back to your guard.

## Box with an app

If you want to get into boxing but are not sure where to start, or if you are already boxing and want to stay motivated when shadow boxing on your own, consider trying out [Shadow Boxing App](/).

This iOS app will call out punches and various other exercises [just like pad work](/pad-work-boxing-reflexes/). It works well without gear or [with a punching bag](/new-simple-combo-punching-bag/).
