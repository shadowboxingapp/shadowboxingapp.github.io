Every boxer know that [footwork is important](/footwork-boxing-app/). This is why we recently added [a new feature to our boxing app](/new-footwork-mode-boxing-app/) that focuses more on movement.

A lot of you were curious how it worked, so to [start off 2021](/start-boxing-in-2021/) right here is a quick video showcasing just that:

As you can tell, it has a few different exercises that changes quickly focused on movement. They alternate with an element of randomness so you won't get the exact same thing each time. 

If you find that interesting, feel free to grab the app and give it a try! The exercise is available on its own, as part of larger workouts and you can even add it to your routine in a custom workout!
