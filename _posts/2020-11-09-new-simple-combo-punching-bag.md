This week we'll be releasing the version 1.15 of our boxing app for iOS. There are a couple of interesting new things worth highlighting, so let's get into it!


{% include preview.html %}

## Simple Combos

In it, we're adding a brand new *simple combos* exercise for people who are still learning but want to do more than [jabs](/boxing-basics-jab/) and 1-2s. It starts easy and then it gets more and more complex, while always remaining reasonable.

It's a bit similar to [pad work](/pad-work-boxing-reflexes/) and you'll punch when the app calls for it.

For instance you'll start the round throwing single jabs, crosses and hooks. After 20 seconds it will start combining them in simple sequences, like 1-2 or 1-4.

Once you are getting used to it, the app will mix it up again and make the combos even harder. The single punches are now gone and you are dealing with 1-2-3, 1-2-1-2 and other similar combinations. The punches are straightforward and flow well together, so the whole thing should be pretty fun.

## New Workouts

We've also added a few workouts.

- **PUNCHING BAG REPETITION**: Repeat combos on the [punching bag](/heavy-bag-in-boxing/) with little rest. This one is great for cardio and power.
- **GIVING IT A TRY**: if you're curious and want to check out what a workout looks like in 5 minutes
- **SIMPLE COMBOS**: Train with simple combos getting progressively more difficult. This is perfect for beginners who want to have fun boxing.

We're really happy to always been adding to the list of workouts available. If you want to discover what else already exists in the app, [you can take a look here](/workouts/)!

## Recording Yourself

You can now record yourself in portrait mode, which is better when working on the [punching bag](/punching-bag-app-boxing/). This is also great if you want to share your [shadow boxing workouts](/importance-of-shadow-boxing/) on Instagram.

## Better Help Menus

Some people were struggling to figure out how to use the app. To assist them and help them learn boxing, we've added a few more ways to get help in the app.
