### A Rope Workout That Matches Your Level

The app tailors the session to your current ability. If you’re new, it keeps things simple with steady rhythm rounds. If you’re more advanced, it adds speed bursts, doubles, and footwork patterns.

This means you’re always training in the sweet spot where progress happens.

### Train Footwork With Speed Step Rounds

The app now includes speed-focused rope rounds that teach you to stay light on your feet and move with real boxing rhythm.
 These rounds help wake up your legs, activate your stabilizers, and prepare you for sharper movement during combinations.

Use a speed rope round as your warmup before boxing rounds to instantly improve your timing.

###  Build Explosive Power With Double-Under Sessions

Double-under intervals are now part of the rope programming. These high-intensity bursts train fast-twitch muscle fibers and build the explosive energy you need for powerful punches and quick defensive reactions.

Pair these rounds with power-combo sessions in the app to feel the transfer to your punching speed.

### Boost Conditioning 

High-knee skipping or raised heels is included as well, giving you a conditioning-focused option that mirrors real fight intensity.
 These rounds push your cardio, strengthen your legs, and train you to move with intention under fatigue.

Mix them between combo rounds for a conditioning session that feels like real fight pacing.

### Cardio Conditioning Tailored to Your Level

Jump rope is one of the highest-return cardio tools in combat sports. It elevates your heart rate quickly, strengthens your lungs, and keeps your legs working under continuous tension.

The adaptive system inside the app adjusts your cardio challenge automatically:

- New to skipping? It eases you into steady-paced rounds so your heart rate rises gradually.
- More advanced? It pushes you into faster rope tempos, explosive intervals, and high-knee sets for fight-level conditioning.

You get the perfect cardio workload without overdoing it.

###  Smooth Transitions Between Rope and Boxing Rounds

One of the best parts of the new update is the ability to alternate rope work with:

- Combo rounds
- Defensive movement
- Footwork rounds
- Power and speed sessions

This creates a complete fighter’s workout, helping you build endurance, coordination, and agility without needing extra equipment or planning.
