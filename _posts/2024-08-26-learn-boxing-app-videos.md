We've recently released brand new tutorial videos, and it is now completely possible to learn the basics of boxing using the app.

## Brand new boxing video tutorials

These videos are designed to guide you through essential techniques, from proper stance and footwork to basic punches like jabs, crosses, hooks, and uppercuts. While it will never replace the benefits of going to a boxing gym and working with a coach who can fine-tune your form in real-time, this is an amazing way to start practicing at your own pace and in your own space.

Our app combines expert instruction with on-demand convenience, making it easier than ever to get started in boxing without the pressure of a gym setting. You’ll also find tailored workouts that focus on building stamina, strength, and speed, so each session will challenge you both physically and mentally. For those just beginning their boxing journey, the app offers the perfect foundation to develop good habits and get a feel for the sport, before committing to a gym membership or formal coaching.

## Boxing journeys to learn with an app

In addition to our new tutorial videos, the app also offers easy-to-follow workouts specifically designed for beginners. These guided sessions are structured to help you apply what you've learned in real time. For example, after watching a video that teaches you the basics of the jab and cross, you can immediately put those techniques into action through a workout where the app provides clear callouts and cues. This seamless transition from learning to practicing ensures that you build muscle memory and improve your form with every session.

The workouts are designed to be simple yet effective, allowing you to gradually master each technique at a comfortable pace. Whether you're just learning the ropes or revisiting fundamental skills, the app’s interactive format helps bridge the gap between theory and practice, giving you a hands-on approach to training that makes learning boxing both accessible and fun.
