Boxing is one of the biggest combat sport, and there are many ways to get into it, including with a mobile app on your iOS or Android phone!

Of course if you want to be the next Floyd Mayweather, you'll probably have to get into a gym and have more than one sparring session, but if you're just getting started or are looking to see if this sport is for you, using an app could be a good idea.

## Why start boxing with an app

While training at home is not perfect, and nothing will be better than having a great coach and boxing gym, there are still great reasons to use an app.

- **No boxing gyms in your area.** In many places there are just no proper gyms, so you don't really have an option. Most people won't have the time to comute far to get a boxing workout in, and it's hard to get motivated on your own.
- **Boxing gyms can be expensive.** Depending on your region, a boxing gym membership can be a few hundred dollars, which can be a lot for some people. Apps are usually cheaper and offer free options.
- **Wanting to get back in shape before going to the gym.** It's not fun to be completely out of shape and feeling bad surrounded by more experienced people. Taking a couple of months to increase your stamina and build the relevant muscles could be a great way to build confidence!
- **Stay motivated.** It's hard to stay committed to your boxing training on your own. Apps usually provide some kind of progress tracking, making you more accountable, and therefore helping you staying motivated and focused.

## What app to pick to learn boxing?

There are many apps to pick, and if you want to get a detailed review of a few ones we recommend you take a look at this [Top 5 Best Boxing Apps of 2022](/best-ios-boxing-apps-in-2022/). Howeve if you were to only pick one, [the Shadow Boxing App](https://apps.apple.com/app/shadow-boxing-workout/id1510911574) is a great choice.

### App that calls out punches

[The Shadow Boxing App](https://apps.apple.com/app/shadow-boxing-workout/id1510911574)  numbers the basics punches and calls the out and you just have to follow the instructions. It goes as follow:

- 1 for jab
- 2 for cross
- 3 for left hook
- 4 for right hook
- 5 for left uppercut
- 6 for right uppercut

So if the app calls out "1-2", you just need to throw [a jab](/boxing-basics-jab/) and then a cross. If you don't know what any of these punches are, there are also explanations inside the app.

## Joining a Gym

Working out with an app is a great way to practice boxing, but if you have the possibility, also give joining a gym a try. The one thing that an app will never be able to provide is the experience of actually sparring with another person!
