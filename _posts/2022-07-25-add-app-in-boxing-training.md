## Only so much days available at the gym

Some boxing gyms only offer trainings a couple of times a week and that's it! What if you want to train every day? In this case having a mobile app that calls out punches and gives you a full workout can be a great way to stay focused even at home. The [Shadow Boxing App](/) is the perfect virtual coach for this and will help you keep your training going even when the gym is closed.

## More classes means more money

In some places you'll pay by the day, so it means that more classes will cost you more... and that can become a problem for most people. The [Shadow Boxing App](/) provides a few fully free workouts, as well as a completely free timer, so you can get a good workout in for free. In case you like it a lot, you can purchase the premium plan that is a fraction of other apps like Freelytics.

In this situation, using the [Shadow Boxing App](/)'s custom workouts is the perfect solution. You can just customize everything - timing, exercises, combos - and get exactly what you were looking for.
