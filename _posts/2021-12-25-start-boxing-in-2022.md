There were quite a number of great fights in 2021, some that we even [highlighted on this blog](/best-boxing-matches-2021/)! This of course inspired a lot of people to follow the sport... so the next logical step is to give it a go!

Now that the holidays are over, it is the prefect moment to loose the extra weight and start working out. For this, boxing is perfect as it will drive you to do all the basic fitness exercises like [burpees](/burpees-in-boxing/) or pushups, but with a clearer prupose than only getting fit.

There are many ways to start boxing. You can do it with [a punching bag](/punching-bag-app-boxing/) or just do some [shadow boxing](/importance-of-shadow-boxing/) on your own. While the sport is hard to master, it's fairly easy to get started with [basic punches](/boxing-basics-jab/) and [simple combinations](/boxing-basic-combos/). You don't even need boxing gloves for shadow boxing!

If you want to make sure to stay motivated through the year, a good option is to join a gym or use an app. If you want to see an overview of options for iOS, you can take a look at [our selection of the top 5 boxing apps for 2022](/best-ios-boxing-apps-in-2022/) and try the ones that you like the most!
