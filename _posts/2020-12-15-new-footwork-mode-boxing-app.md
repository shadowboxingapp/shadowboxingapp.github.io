We recently released the 1.16 version of [Shadow Boxing App](/), our iOS mobile application for boxing training at home.

In the [previous release](/new-simple-combo-punching-bag/) we focused on hitting hard with various [punching bag](/punching-bag-app-boxing/) exercises. This time it's the opposite, everything is focused on movement. This is key as a lot of people mistakenly think boxing is all about arm strenght when really the best boxers have explosive footwork to attack quickly, avoid getting hit and keep control of the ring.

If it looks interesting to you, you just need to download the app, tighten your shoes and get ready to alternate between 5 simple drills  that will improve your stability and speed!

This new exercise also gave  us the idea to mix [footwork](/footwork-boxing-app/), [dodges](/boxing-dodge-app/), jump rope, freestyle & squats into a new training that will get your legs ready for a fight! With this new workout we are finally covering all the basics requirement for a complete boxing workout, so we're looking forward to see how people will use it.
