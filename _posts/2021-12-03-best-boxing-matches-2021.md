## 1/ Tyson Fury vs Deontay Wilder III

**T-Mobile Arena, Las Vegas - 9 October 2021**

In the final portion of the year these two giants clashed for the third and final time. Tyson Fury comprehensively established his dominance over Deontay Wilder with an 11th-round stoppage. Just like in their first fight, which was ultimately declared a draw, Fury was dropped twice but eventually outlasted his heavy-handed rival.

However, similar to their second meeting, Tyson continued to use his size and strength to bully Wilder; push him on to the back foot and wear down his resistance and stamina reserves. Viewed as the better boxer of the pair, Fury showed his grit to battle through the tough periods and destroy an opponent who arrived with 41 big knockout wins on his record. Even Wilder’s rabid fan base were forced to admit that their man was soundly defeated as Fury took hold of the WBC title.

### Fight Highlight

Fury’s final crushing blow removed Wilder from his senses and sent the Alabama banger crushed to the canvas. The image circulated around the sporting world to signal Fury’s undisputable position as the king of the heavyweight division.

## 2/ Terence Crawford vs Shawn Porter

**Mandalay Bay, Las Vegas - 20 November 2021**

Plagued by detractors who point to his questionable run of recent opponents, Terence Crawford was determined to put on a show in Las Vegas. The spiteful switch-hitter was boxing on pretty even terms for the first portion of his fight with former IBF welterweight world champion “Showtime'' Shawn Porter. 

When his corner informed “Bud” before the 10th round that they believed he was down on the cards, the Omaha man flicked the kill switch. Bludgeoning Porter to the canvas twice with heavy blows, the second knockdown prompted Porter’s own corner to stop the fight.

With his contract to Bob Arum’s Top Rank promotional outfit now expired Terence Crawford will be seeking out the biggest names available and is expected to either remain a free agent or sign with the PBC where most of the top welterweights currently reside. One of those welterweights is generational rival Errol Spence Jr who previously defeated Shawn Porter on points. Crawford went one better by stopping the tough Ohio native. Crawford vs. Spence is one of the biggest fights to be made in the sport right now.

### Fight Highlight

Disappointed after being dropped for a second time, Shawn Porter pounded the canvas in frustration as his father Kenny climbed the ring apron to signal the end of his son’s challenge. It was a powerful moment and Porter later announced his retirement from the sport.

## 3/ Oleksandr Usyk vs Anthony Joshua

**Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, London - 25 September 2021**

Boxing just weeks before heavyweight rivals Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder, England’s Anthony Joshua was aiming to send out a statement and set up a dream fight with the winner of that contest. His dream plans turned into a nightmare as swift southpaw Oleksandr Usyk put on a quality boxing display to outpoint AJ in front of his home crowd and send the heavyweight division into a spin.

Boxing, moving and even hurting Joshua at times, Usyk was the boss at the beginning and the end of the bout and thoroughly deserved his victory, plus all of the belts on offer. The rock solid road warrior fights any opponent and is not afraid to travel for his opportunities. As a former undisputed cruiserweight king Usyk is now a major player at heavyweight and is expected to fight Joshua in a rematch early next year. 

### Fight Highlight

Desperately clinging on to avoid being stopped, while trying to reserve any last shred of dignity, Anthony Joshua now claims he is eager to right the wrongs with Usyk in a contracted rematch. The fearless Ukrainian has other ideas. His shellacking of Joshua in the final 20 seconds of the contest might give an indication of how a return fight would play out. Usyk will be looking to win by knockout this time.
