When I built the shadow boxing app, the focus was on the workouts. You could pick from various exercises, define the combos you wanted to practice, [workout with your heavy bag](/new-heavybag-mode/) and so on, and this was supposed to be all I would work on.

## Where are the good free boxing timers?

However, as a boxer it always was very annoying to not have a well made [boxing timer available on iOS](/best-round-timer-apps-boxing/). At first I would be sparring at the gym and would struggle restarting the default iPhone timer. I then downloaded a few apps, and they all had problems.

Either they were free, but filled with ads, or they were too expensive for just a simple timer. They would add a ton of features to time HIIT or Tabata training which I didn't care for. This made the whole experience way more complicated than what it needed to be.

## What I really needed

Really when you're sparring you only need a timer that is:

- **Simple** to use because you'll be tired
- Allows you to **set a round duration** (but defaults to 3 minutes)
- Has a **good volume**, because you're not going to hear it while getting punched in the face
- With a **large font and visual cues** so you can check the time remaining quickly & from afar

Since I didn't find it, I decided to build it and release it for free as a sub section of the Shadow Boxing App.

## It's available for free

It's now built and looks like this:

<div style='text-align: center'><img src='/assets/screenshots/web_screenshot_5.png' style='width: 200px;margin: 20px 0px 30px 0px;' alt='Free boxing timer'/></div>

As you can see, it's dead simple, but to me it works great for what I needed it to do: be a timer when I do sparring or some very simple free form shadow boxing.

Overall it's not much, but it fits what I need it to do, and it's completely free and without ads, and it will remain this way as long as the app is available to download!
