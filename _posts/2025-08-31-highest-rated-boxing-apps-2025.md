Training with an app gives you expert guidance and structure. Whether you're shadow boxing, hitting the heavy bag, or mastering technique, it makes things more fun and helps staying focused. The best-rated apps offer workout variety, real coaching cues, and motivating performance tracking. Ready to see what top contenders are dominating the scene in 2025?

## Methodology

First we searched for apps relevant to boxing available on the App Store, Play Store or both. We extended to fitness apps that are not entirely focused on boxing but would help anyone practice boxing. We did not include apps about nutrition as we wanted to focus on actual training. Then we selected the ones with at least 100 reviews across platforms to remove statistical anomalies, and then kept the top 11 in terms of review count.

Finally we took the available user ratings of each app at the time of writing this article (August 31 2025) on all platforms they were available (If there is a web version, we'll rely on [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/) data) and averaged them. For instance if an app has 4/5 on iOS and 4.5/5 on Android, we'll show 4.25. 

We then offer you the list alongside the app logo and a quick example from the app's review.

Note that we were working with the data available at the time, so there are a lot of caveats. Some apps can dismiss previous ratings with an update, Android and Apple do not handle reviews exactly the same... however we feel like this give you a decent overview of what is available and you can then make your own opinion.

It's worth noting that the app's score is signficantly lower on Android with people complaining about the hardware part of the app.

> Very misleading. Tried the free trial but it turns you need to buy a €44 tracking strap before you can even do any of the workouts. I tried to start a few but they all required the strap. Then it's over 80€ a year for the subscription. Bad deal and sleazy business practices. Hard pass.
