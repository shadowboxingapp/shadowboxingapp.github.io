- **Weight**: Heavier bags are better for power training, while lighter bags are ideal for speed and technique work. Choose a weight that’s challenging but allows you to maintain form.
- **Material**: Leather bags are durable and offer a natural feel, while synthetic bags are more affordable and still provide solid performance.
- **Space and Installation**: Make sure to choose a bag that fits the space available in your training area. Freestanding bags are easier to set up, while hanging bags require more space and mounting equipment.
