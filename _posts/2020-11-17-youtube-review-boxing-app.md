It's always great to see people try out the app and share their boxing workout video using [the recording featured released recently](/new-simple-combo-punching-bag/). Today you can check out Armo Mema's video review where he explains how the application works and does a demonstration. The video itself is now a bit old and the app evolved a lot, but it gives a sense of the kind of fitness exercises you can get done with our mobile app.

As you can see, he is doing the simple combos workout, where it starts simple and then build up into more interesting combinations. In this exercise, the app behaves like a coach doing [pad work with you](/pad-work-boxing-reflexes/), but keep in mind that there are tons of other kinds of things you can do with the app including freestyle, punching bag and so on.

If this felt like something you'd be interested in, you can go ahead and [download the app](/)!
