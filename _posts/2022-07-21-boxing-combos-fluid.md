There are lots of different combos in boxing, and some are way more fun to throw mindlessly. For instance going 1-2-3 or "jab-cross-hook" feels really natural, you move your body from side to side... it's a lot of fun! In contrast, if you go 1-3-1 or "jab-left hook-jab" you'll feel your left arm burn more and having to go back to your guard between punches will feel awkward.  It's good to know how to mix it up, but it's way harder to pull off.

This is why in the latest version of the [Shadow Boxing App](/) we added a new "Flowing Combos" mode, for all these times where you just want to throw quick combinations that just feel perfectly right.

## Examples of flowing boxing combinations

Here is a quick preview of some of these boxing combos that will be called out by the application:

- 1-2-3: the classic, you can't go wrong with this one
- 1-1-2: doubling the jab usually becomes a great habbit to have, perfect to approach opponents and create openings
- 1-2-1-2: going fast, going strong
- 1-2-3-4: attacking from many angles and going fast while ending with a strong hook from the rear hand.

... and much more, so try it out!

Of course, you can also create the combos you prefer with our [combo creator feature](/build-custom-combos-boxing-app/)!
