I always felt like there wasn't enough cardio exercises in the app, so for the past few months I added a lot of things around [footwork](/boxing-footwork-app/) and [calisthenics](/burpees-in-boxing/) which helped, but it often felt less like boxing and more like any other workout app.

However today I'm very happy to release this new exercise called "Boxing + Cardio" because I think this is exactly what I was looking to build. It is both exhausting and rewarding to complete, but it is also a lot of fun and related to boxing. Pushups and burpees are nice, but I don't want to just be doing a random HIIT workout... here I've incorporated boxing elements into most of the exercises to keep it fun and relevant.

If you pick this exercise in a custom workout, the app will pick 3 drills from a list of 10 and you will do them one after the other for ~20 seconds each. There is no break, so if you pick a 3 minutes round be prepared to sweat!

The drills at the moment are the following:

- Lunges with an added punch from the oposite hand
- Squats with 2 punches each repetition
- Non stop combos ([because combinations are important](/boxing-basic-combos/))
- Non stop 1 2
- Raised knees con golpes constantes
- Jumping jacks
- Heel taps con golpes constantes
- Jump squats
- Non stop 1 2 3 4 5 6
- Switch stances quickly

As you can tell, there are a few and getting a new group of 3 each time a round start will keep it fresh for quite a while!
