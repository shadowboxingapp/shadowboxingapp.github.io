## No boxing gyms nearby

In a lot of places you will just not find any gym, and not many people feel like doing long comutes just to work out. If that's the case you'll be left with no other options than training at home or giving up on your plan of boxing. Training with an app is then a great way to stay motivated.

## Bad experience with the local gym

Most gyms are great, with experienced coaches, friendly boxers and many things to learn. However some places can be toxic, with people fighting hard with beginners or trainers that do not really care. If that's the case, it's not motivating to keep going there and training with an app becomes less stressful.

## A gym can get expensive

This of course depends on where you live, but boxing gyms memberships can go up to a few hundred dollars, even more, which can be a lot. Apps are always cheaper than this and even provide free options.
