To give back to the community and show more people what can be done with the app, we are giving **3 free months** of subscription for anyone sharing a video of them using the app on Youtube.

This program is limited in time and can be discountinued at any time, so if you are interested please act now!

## Who can participate?

Anyone above the legal majority of their country can participate. Participation is limited at one time per person. 

You also have to agree to have the video used by the Shadow Boxing App for educational and promotional usage, included but not limited to the app itself, the app's youtube channel, blog or instagram page. You can already see some people who participated in the past [on our Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@shadowboxingworkout1467/videos).

## Participating

### 1/ Record

To participate you must use the in-app feature to record video. If you're not sure how to do this, you can follow [this simple video explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83DjPW32AcI) with a step by step way to record your video.

Note that the video doesn't need to be a masterpiece, but it needs to be well lit, have sound and have you in frame. [Here is a good video example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTxzGUbYII).

<div style='text-align: center'><img src='/assets/video_preview.png' style='width: 100%;margin: 10px 0px 30px 0px;' alt='Video of someone boxing with an app'/></div>

### How to upload?

Once the video is on your phone, you can add it to Youtube. To do so, download the Youtube app and [follow the instructions ](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57407?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS). You'll see that it is quite simple.

### How to send the video?

Once this is done, [fill in this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_W7kuNKx37qlHl6yr_9rzzudhA8SP14QlumByudL_Ac/edit).

We'll get back shortly to you with a coupon you'll be able to redeem [on this page](https://apps.apple.com/redeem/?ctx=offercodes&id=1510911574) giving you access to the monthly subscription for free during 3 months.
