Progress in boxing isn’t always easy to measure. Unlike lifting weights, you can’t just count the plates on the bar. But with the Shadow Boxing App, you get **detailed stats that track your progress**—so you always know how far you’ve come, and where you’re headed next.

## Why Tracking Your Progress Matters

When you can see the numbers behind your workouts, you stay motivated. Tracking helps you:

- **Stay consistent** by seeing your streaks and sessions add up
- **Measure improvement** with longer rounds, more combos, or higher intensity
- **Set goals** and crush them one by one
- **Keep motivated** knowing every punch and round is moving you forward

Instead of guessing whether you’re getting better, the data tells the story.

## The Stats You’ll See in the App

The [Shadow Boxing App]() doesn’t just give you a workout—it keeps score of your effort. Some of the stats you’ll see include:

- **Workouts completed** – watch your training log grow
- **Total rounds** – track how many you’ve fought through
- **Time trained** – see your total hours add up like a fighter’s career record
- **Calories burned** – a bonus for those using boxing for fitness

... and much more.

These numbers turn every sweat session into visible progress.

## Watch Yourself Improve Over Time

One of the best feelings is looking back at your history and realizing how much you’ve grown. Maybe you started with three 2-minute rounds, and now you’re crushing six 3-minute rounds. Or maybe your punch count has doubled. The app makes that journey clear, so you know the work is paying off.

## Motivation in Your Pocket

It’s no wonder so many users [love the app](). Tracking your progress feels like having a personal trainer reminding you how far you’ve come—and pushing you toward the next level.

Whether you’re [learning how to box]() or training like a pro, stats keep you accountable, motivated, and hungry for more.

Open the Shadow Boxing App today, start tracking your training, and watch your progress build round by round.
