  content: Was the exact timer app I was looking for. No more stock iPhone timer! You can tell this was made by someone who actually fights. The shadow boxing workouts are great too!

  content: "Found out about this app on reddit, and i canâ€™t simply have enough. Itâ€™s easy to use, highly customizable, and clever in itâ€™s workout creation. I did not have to sub to the app to use it fully but decided to do it anyway to support the creator best i could. They listen to feedback and improve very fast, if i could give more than 5 star i definetly would, my striking skills have improved a ton since working out with the app. If youâ€™re not using it in these dark times well.. youâ€™re missing out"

- title: 5 stars well deserved
  content: Iâ€™ve practice thai boxing for now 7 years. I had to move away from the gym due to the lock down. This app is amazing to keep some of the discipline I had at the gym. It is so customisable that one could be addicted to. Developers, keep doing what you do ðŸ”¥ It would be nice to have it compatible with Spotify or to include Muay thai music, eye of the tigger or some free content with the same mood ðŸ¥Š

- title: Definitely a must get app
  content: If youâ€™re a beginner you should definitely download this. I looked around at different boxing gyms and theyâ€™re just so expensive and the environments are a bit intimidating to a person brand new to the sport. I ended up downloading this app and the first few workouts have taught me so much and have really given me the sweats. Iâ€™m working out alone with this yet feel just as motivated to continue the workouts as if I were with a coach.

- title: Amazing
  content: This app is like having a one-to-one boxing trainer, whenever I want. It enables me to train however I want, at a time it suits me and current recovery, rather than having to attend a specific time at a boxing gym, where you donâ€™t get as much one-on-one time.
