This app has me hooked though, really great simple tool and I can actually feel my natural rhythm improving. Canâ€™t recommend it enough - whether you are looking for a workout or relax/cool down at the end of a day. Great free content and the subscription price is an absolute bargain. Thank you!"

  content: "Found out about this app on reddit, and i canâ€™t simply have enough. Itâ€™s easy to use, highly customizable, and clever in itâ€™s workout creation. I did not have to sub to the app to use it fully but decided to do it anyway to support the creator best i could. They listen to feedback and improve very fast, if i could give more than 5 star i definetly would, my striking skills have improved a ton since working out with the app. If youâ€™re not using it in these dark times well.. youâ€™re missing out"

- title: 5 stars well deserved
  content: Iâ€™ve practice thai boxing for now 7 years. I had to move away from the gym due to the lock down. This app is amazing to keep some of the discipline I had at the gym. It is so customisable that one could be addicted to. Developers, keep doing what you do ðŸ”¥ It would be nice to have it compatible with Spotify or to include Muay thai music, eye of the tigger or some free content with the same mood ðŸ¥Š
