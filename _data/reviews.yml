  content: "As a retired military bomb disposal type, have some stress. I bought all the apps for boxing and kickboxing as well as a cheapo heavy bag. This is the best of all the apps if you just want to work out and improve your game. Get it, use it, or stay on the bench."

  content: Was the exact timer app I was looking for. No more stock iPhone timer! You can tell this was made by someone who actually fights. The shadow boxing workouts are great too!

  content: "Iâ€™ve been around boxing gyms for a few years and the only bit Iâ€™ve never got into is shadow boxing. This app has me hooked though, really great simple tool and I can actually feel my natural rhythm improving. Canâ€™t recommend it enough - whether you are looking for a workout or relax/cool down at the end of a day. Great free content and the subscription price is an absolute bargain. Thank you!"

  content: "Found out about this app on reddit, and i canâ€™t simply have enough. Itâ€™s easy to use, highly customizable, and clever in itâ€™s workout creation. I did not have to sub to the app to use it fully but decided to do it anyway to support the creator best i could. They listen to feedback and improve very fast, if i could give more than 5 star i definetly would, my striking skills have improved a ton since working out with the app. If youâ€™re not using it in these dark times well.. youâ€™re missing out"

- title: 5 stars well deserved
  content: Iâ€™ve practice thai boxing for now 7 years. I had to move away from the gym due to the lock down. This app is amazing to keep some of the discipline I had at the gym. It is so customisable that one could be addicted to. Developers, keep doing what you do ðŸ”¥ It would be nice to have it compatible with Spotify or to include Muay thai music, eye of the tigger or some free content with the same mood ðŸ¥Š
