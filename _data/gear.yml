- name: "Gloves"
  blurb: |
    Obviously if you're only shadow boxing, you do not need a pair of gloves.
    However, this is best that you train as you'll fight, so having gloves
    even for shadow can be a good idea. It'll also add weight and make it
    harder to keep your guard up... and getting used to having one's guard
    up when tired is very important.
