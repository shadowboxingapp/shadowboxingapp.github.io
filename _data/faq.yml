- q: I don't know how to box, can I use the Shadow Boxing App?
  a: |
    Of course! There are many videos and beginner friendly workouts to learn. Most people
    like to begin with our "Start boxing in 30 minutes" plan, which is a great way to start
    shadow boxing with no experience.

- q: How technically deep is the app?

     right away regardless of level, it goes beyond
     fitness or "boxercise". This means that you will find more technical exercises pour experienced boxers.

- q: Do I need any equipment?

     However, if you have a punching bag, there are workouts designed specifically for it.

- q: Is the app free?

     a free boxing timer available both on the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch.
     Then the app offers a premium version to go further and unlock all customisation features.
